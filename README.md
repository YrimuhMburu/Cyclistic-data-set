Question: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
Objective: 
The objective is to analyze how differently the usage of bikes by annual members as opposed to casual members. The goal is to leverage these insights so as to tailor make marketing strategies to encourage casual members to enroll as annual members 
To get insights I have used data sets from Cyclistic historical data from January 2024 to July 2024 to conduct my analysis. My choice of tool to conduct the analysis is MS Excel. I chose excel as I was able to combine all the table and use all the data in its entirety and I could generate pivot tables for summary 
The steps taken are: -
Cleaning and standardizing the data this to ensure that all the data is the same data format, getting rid of null values and removing duplicates
Data manipulation I calculated the duration of ride and also get the day of week when ride took place so as to know which day and hour was popular for each type of bike user.
Visualizations used: -
I have used pivot tables to be able to summarize the data better so that I can generate visualizations to be able to compare bike usage different types of users.
Insights: -
Pivot_table1 the most popular day for people to use the bikes is day 3 with total of 173182
Pivot_table2 the average time spent by casual users is more than the members 
Pivot_table3 the longest time was on the bikes by casual users was on day 7 and also members was also on day 7
Pivot_table4 in terms of number of people using the bikes the members who used the bikes was more than the casual users
Pivot_table5 and Pivot_table7 there was a clear preference where classic bikes were used more than the electric bikes. Where classic bikes were used more by 30825 than electric bikes. But the casual members prefer electric bikes to classic bikes while members prefer classic bikes to electric bikes 
Pivot_table6 the pivot table with combination with heat map properties shows that the popular hour when the bikes were used was 5pm for members. For casual users the most popular hour was 5pm


Recommendations:
1.Capitalize on Peak Days and Times
•	Targeted Promotions: 
Having targeted promotions especially on popular days i.e. day 3 and day 7 and happy hour deals since both casual and members prefer riding bikes at 5 pm. I would recommend that targeted promotions to target casual riders to enroll as members such as discounted weekend only passes as casual riders prefer extended rides during weekends.
2.Increase Membership Conversion by Highlighting the Benefits of Frequent Use
•	Membership Incentives:
o	Market the benefits of membership by emphasizing the cost-effectiveness for frequent riders, particularly those who use bikes regularly on Day 3 and during peak hours.
o	Free Trial Memberships: Offer free trials or temporary membership upgrades to casual users who frequently ride on popular days, allowing them to experience the benefits of membership.
3. Promote Classic Bikes to Casual Users
•	Classic Bike Campaign:
o	Since classic bikes are more popular, Cyclistic can run campaigns specifically promoting the classic bike experience to casual users, possibly by highlighting the history or unique features of these bikes.
•	Exclusive Classic Bike Access: Offer exclusive access to classic bikes for members or create events where classic bikes are highlighted, possibly offering classic bike-only rides.
